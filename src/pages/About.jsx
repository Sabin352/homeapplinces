      <h1>About Home Appliences</h1>
      <p>
        Given a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance
        is tied to the definition of appliance as "an instrument or device
        designed for a particular use or function".[5] More specifically,
        Collins English Dictionary defines "home appliance" as: "devices or
        machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to
        do jobs such as cleaning or cooking".[6] The broad usage, afforded to
        the definition, allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use
        to be a home appliance, including consumer electronics as well as
        stoves,[7] refrigerators, toasters[7] and air conditioners.

        While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained
        electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation
        that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these
        appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time domestic servants
        and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of
        more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances
        included washing machines, water heaters, refrigerators, kettles and
        sewing machines. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric
        clothes iron in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance
        industry. In the Post–World War II economic expansion, the domestic use
        of dishwashers, and clothes dryers were part of a shift for convenience.
        Increasing discretionary income was reflected by a rise in miscellaneous
        home appliances.[8][9][self-published source] In America during the
        1980s, the industry shipped $1.5 billion worth of goods each year and
        employed over 14,000 workers, with revenues doubling between 1982 and
        1990 to $3.3 billion. Throughout this period, companies merged and
        acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and
        eliminate competitors, resulting in antitrust legislation.

      <h1>History Of Home Appliances</h1>
      <p>
        The use of appliances can be traced back many years, but the first gas
        or electric-powered appliance wasn’t invented until the 20th-century.
        The first home appliances invented were the refrigerator and kettle.
        Following World War II, the economy expanded and more people went back
        to work. In an attempt to improve productivity and minimize the time it
        took to complete household duties, many of these appliances were sold to
        residential consumers.

        The increase in income during this time period also made home appliances
        more affordable to most consumers. Home appliances picked up in
        popularity in the 1980s, and nearly every household owned the major home
        appliances, including refrigerators, stoves, ovens, and microwave ovens.
        Concerns of energy use arose in the 1980s with the increase of use, and
        the government stepped in to put requirements on the top manufacturers,
        requiring them to reduce energy consumption year over year.
